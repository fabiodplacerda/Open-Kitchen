      'Classic Italian pasta dish. This Spaghetti Carbonara is a traditional Roman recipe that combines simplicity and indulgence. Made with al dente spaghetti, creamy egg yolks, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and crispy pancetta, this dish offers a perfect balance of flavors. The secret to its creamy texture lies in the technique of tossing the hot pasta with the egg mixture off the heat, ensuring a silky, smooth sauce without any cream. Finished with a generous sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper, this Carbonara is a comforting and satisfying meal that highlights the elegance of authentic Italian cooking. Perfect for a quick weeknight dinner or a special gathering with friends and family.',

Chill in the refrigerator.\n\nLay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place 4 slices of Parma ham in the middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.',
